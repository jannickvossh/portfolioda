# My Danish portfolio site

## Why Jekyll?
So I recently realized a huge problem with my previous portfolios.
It has always been a pain in the butt to constantly write new HTML and CSS for **every single one** of my posts whenever I have made something new.
So instead I chose to think of it as blog posts instead. And since I don't have a very keen eye on building dynamic sites with databases and all that fancy stuff, and since something like WordPress would be way to overkill for just a portfolio site (and way too slow), I decided to just use a static site generator.

## The design
I wanted something a bit more easily digestible than my previous portfolio sites, so I decided to take a bunch of classes on Skillshare and read a bit around to see how other artists and designers have made theirs, and I used some of the tips and tricks I learned to make my design.
Then it was just a matter of doing some quick sketches and setting up a rough design in XD.  
Anyway, here's the design I came up with. My final product may be a bit or even totally different, but this is what I want to use for reference:
